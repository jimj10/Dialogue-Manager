# Dialogue Manager

Dialogue Manager (DM) is a C#/.NET application for generating and playing audio clips. 

The app was developed as a 'Wizard of Oz' tool in the Informatics Department, University of Sussex, to support the CONVER-SE research project investigating the use of voice user interfaces to program smart devices in the home.

DM can be used offline or online. For offline use, users can create short audio clips from text (using Google's text to speech), or add pre-recorded audio clips. The clips are ordered, labelled and colour coded for rapid selection. When used online, pre-loaded audio clips can be modified or new text entered for immediate conversion to speech. Different voices can be selected and the speech rate altered as required.

The app can also be used for more complex trigger-action ruleset-based interactive sessions. In this mode audio clips are linked together in different ways to produce a range of responses for the study scenarios.
